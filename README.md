Memory Game is a front end React app that give the user a fun memory test game with images. The data that keeps track of score and images is stored in a JSON file. In this game your score is determined by how many images you can click with out clicking one that you have already clicked. What makes it challenging is that there is a method in react that shuffles all images everytime you click one. Each successful click adds one point to your score and the top score is also kept track of. Have fun!
